# Changelog

## 1.0.2
- Allow components like `UniversalAdditionalCameraData` from `com.unity.render-pipelines.universal` to be correctly re-mapped - before this fix only the first class of the file could actually be matched.

## 1.0.1
- Clean up the dumped AssetRipper project unless in Dev mode, toggleable in settings.
